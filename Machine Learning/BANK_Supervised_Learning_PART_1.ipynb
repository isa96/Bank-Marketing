Socio-economic features such as emp.var.rate, euribor3m and nr.employed have quite the same correlation ratio with the target.  Since they are highly correlated with each other and having this kind of relationship with the target, I am cosidering to drop the columns emp.var.rate and nr.employed. Another thing to back this up is there is no further explanation about those two features. Thus I will keep euribor3m. Month is correlated with most socio-economic features, because some of the features are monthly based or quarterly based."

Therefore, I think we need to pick precision and recall, to make sure that our model correctly predicting the Target Yes. \n",

    "* A higher score in recall for Target Yes is more desired for aggresive type of bank, because it indicates a lower False Negative (cases which are actually positive, but predicted negative). Since we have much smaller case of Target Yes, finding the true Target Yes is important, because it means we get the customer who will buy the product or in this case putting the deposit in the bank (customer acquisition). If we have a high False Negative, means we missed our customer and bank can probably lost revenue.\n",
